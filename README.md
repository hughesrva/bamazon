# bamazon

### Bamazon is a CLI app that allows a customer to purchase items based on what stock is listed in the database.

##### The app starts off by showing the user a list of what's available, how much each unit costs and how many units are currently in stock.

##### The user is then prompted to enter the ID# for the item they'd like to purchase, followed by how many they want to purchase.

###### If the chosen amount is available, the user is shown their total price and given the option to make a purchase. The chosen amount is also deducted from the database's available stock.

###### If there is not enough in stock to meet the user's request, the user is given an error message and taken back to the list of available products.
